Maze <Puzzle
The Maze-Puzzle a rectangular maze where each cell is either empty (contains 0) or blocked
(contains 1). There is a special cell designated as start cell and there are some cells designated as
goal cells. Our search agent (Raju) need to find an escaping path from given a maze. There are
some searching strategies that we need to follow in finding the optimal path. The aims of this maze
puzzle is to understand different search strategies. Consider an overly simple example for this
programming assignment:
Dimension 5 x 5
Initial State= starting cell (0, 0)
Goal State= goal cell (4, 4)
Optimal Path = {(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)} with Path Cost = 5 when all cell movements
have equal unit cost.
